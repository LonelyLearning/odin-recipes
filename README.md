This is my first HTML project. In this project I will apply the HTML knowledge I've gained in these areas:
    - Elements and tags
    - HTML Boilerplate
    - Working with Text in HTML
    - Lists in HTML
    - Links and images in HTML
    - Commit messages

To apply this knowledge I will build a basic recipes website!
